# Description
This project is our final project for Data Science Learning Studio.

**Backgrounder:**

The handling of Covid-19 by the Indonesian government needs to be handled in a targeted manner based on the level of vaccination, level of security, and level of mobility of each province. By knowing the positivity rate and condition of each province, it is hoped that the government can take appropriate policies for each of these provinces.

DTO is a dedicated task force to lead digital transformations within organization which currently on a mission to transform healthcare delivery in Indonesia. Ideate impactful analysis or potential solution that support DTO to give more insightful informations in transforming healthcare delivery in Indonesia.

Data is about utilization of EHac, Microsite, and Peduli Lindungi application.
